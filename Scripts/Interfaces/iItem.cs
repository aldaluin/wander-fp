     *   This interface defines an object type that is not organic to the scene.  It's
     *   dynamically allocated and lit, and in some manner under the control of the player.
     *   It's instantiated from a prototype and (probably) created by a factory.  Instances
     *   will persist through a web data reference and will need to be loaded and saved.
